# dutchfirecalc.nl

Source code for [dutchfirecalc.nl](https://www.dutchfirecalc.nl/). Basically this is the Trinity study (with data from [Robert Shiller](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm), using historical S&P 500 stock prices from 1871 until the present)  while taking Dutch tax law into account.

The backend is built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on top of the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework, using [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) powered HTML templates and charts using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
